## Password Generator - Scrimba Solo Project

### Short description:
An app that generates ready-to-copy passwords. It's my second solo project during the Learn JavaScript for free Course on Scrimba. **Click [here](https://annziel.github.io/password-generator/) to use it!**

### The original requirements:
- generate two random 15-character passwords using `Math.` objects
- implement the design provided via Figma

### My customizations:
I built the extra functionalities proposed as stretch goals, which were beyond the course material. That includes setting the password length and whether it should contain numbers and symbols. While building these features, I learned about the `<input>` element and the `alert` dialog (to inform users that creating passwords longer than 15 characters is impossible). I also got familiar with the `clipboard` concept and added a copy-on-click feature, practiced using custom fonts, and improved at making conditional statements. Finally, I tweaked the original design.

### How it look like:
